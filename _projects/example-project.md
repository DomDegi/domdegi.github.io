# Spectral Element Solver

This project focuses on solving the Navier-Stokes equations using high-order spectral element methods. It was designed to run on distributed memory architectures using MPI for communication and OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism on individual nodes.

## Key Features
- **Scalability**: Tested on hundreds of cores with near-linear strong scaling.
- **Accuracy**: Employs Legendre polynomials for high spatial accuracy.
- **Performance**: Optimized memory access patterns and vectorized inner loops.
