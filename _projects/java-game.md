# Client-Server Game Development with MVC Pattern

Developed a Java-based multiplayer game applying the classic Model-View-Controller paradigm in a 4-person team.

## Architecture
- **Communication:** Implemented using Java RMI and custom Socket protocols.
- **User Interface:** Built with JavaFX.
- **Build System:** Managed via Maven.

## Challenges
- Handled rigorous multi-threading complexities.
- Synchronized states across multiple concurrent remote clients in real-time.
- Heavily applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to keep the codebase maintainable.
