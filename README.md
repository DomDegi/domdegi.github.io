# Personal Portfolio & Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio and blog, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://domdegi.github.io/). 

The site serves as a central hub for my professional identity, showcasing my academic background in Computer Engineering and High Performance Computing, my technical projects, and my ongoing thoughts on scientific computing and software engineering.

## 🚀 Built With
- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**: Static site generator used to transform plain text into a static website.
- **HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS**: A completely custom, lightweight, dark-mode default theme built from scratch without relying on heavy frontend frameworks.
- **GitHub Pages**: For seamless CI/CD and hosting.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `_pages/`: Contains the markdown files for the pages of the website.
- `_layouts/`: Contains the core HTML structure (`default.html` and `page.html`).
- `assets/`: Holds custom CSS, vanilla JS for the theme toggle, images, and documents (like CV PDFs).
- `_projects/`: A Jekyll Collection where each Markdown file automatically generates a dedicated project page.
- `_posts/`: Markdown files for blog entries.
